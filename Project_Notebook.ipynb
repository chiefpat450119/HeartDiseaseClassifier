    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heart disease is a significant global health concern; it is the *leading cause of death globally*. To address this issue effectively, it is vital to develop accurate diagnostic tools. Fortunately, there are many patient attributes that could serve as indicators or possible warning signs for heart disease, which could accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment. In this project, we will employ classification techniques to predict the diagnosis of heart disease based on a few of these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question:** Will a patient be diagnosed with heart disease, given their age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate achieved, while considering sex differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use to answer this question is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which comprises multivariate numerical and categorical data on 14 patient attributes. These include age, sex, chest pain type, etc. along with the patient's diagnosis. For this project, we will focus on a subset of attributes: \n",
    "- age\n",
    "- resting blood pressure\n",
    "- serum cholesterol\n",
    "- maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "to predict the diagnosis of heart disease. We will filter the dataset to include only records from the Cleveland location to ensure consistency and relevance. By the end of this project, we aim to develop accurate predictive models for diagnosing heart disease based on patient attributes."

We will then split the data into training and testing sets. The disease classes will be combined into one because some of the original classes had too few observations to use classification effectively (large class imbalance), seen in table 2 where critical condition only had 9 observations.\n",
    "Then, we will select the following predictors: age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate.\n",
    "These were chosen because they are numerical variables, which are much more useful than the other categorical variables for KNN classification, and they also do not have any missing data (see table 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "For model fitting and evaluation, we will split the training and testing sets both into male and female sets, due to the notable sex differences in diagnoses and predictor variables, seen in the discrepancies between male and female graphs in figure 1 and figure 2. We will be training a K-nearest neighbours classification model, so we will first need to use a recipe to scale and center the data. The model will be trained on the training set, using cross-validation to choose the optimal value of K, then evaluated on the testing set using accuracy, precision, and recall. Recall will be prioritized because false negative predictions (classifying disease \"present\" as \"absent\") are more costly. This evaluation process will be conducted separately for male and female categories to account for sex-specific variations.\n",

    "We will also visualize the accuracy, precision, and recall for both the male and female datasets when the model is evaluated on the **test data** using a combined bar chart, and also compare it to the cross-validation accuracy from the training set. Lastly, we will also display the confusion matrix (true positives, false positives, etc.) for each sex."

    "We can see that the KNN classification model was somewhat successful in terms of accuracy for the male dataset, with an accuracy of around 65% according to figure 5. Precision is also moderately high at around 70%. However, considering the context of this data analysis, recall should be the most important metric to consider, since it is the ratio of correct positive predictions to total actual positives. This means that it is impacted by false negatives, which are the most costly errors in the context of predicting disease, since it would be very bad to predict a diseased case as healthy. For the male dataset, the recall is rather mediocre at around 65%, which would mean this prediction model is not suitable for diagnosing heart disease in new patients."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "**SUMMARY:**\n",
    "**Add a lot more details (specifically mention predictor variables)**\n",
    "The findings indicate that the recall metric, particularly important for diagnosing heart disease, shows that the model performs moderately well for male patients but not for female patients. This implies that the model is more successful at correctly identifying cases of heart disease among male patients compared to female patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXPECTATIONS vs. FINDINGS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results for male patients align somewhat with expectations, as there was a significantly greater proportion of male patients in the disease classes, suggesting that the model might perform better due to a larger sample size. However, the findings for female patients are unexpected, as the selected variables did not yield the desired level of performance in predicting heart disease. **Talk more about why the female patients dataset didn't perform well (class imbalance, very small sample size)**\n",
    "**Also talk about why we didn't do a colour diagram to find out if under/overfitting was the problem (too computationally expensive)** Previous literature found models precisions of 0.8671 for males and 0.8991 for females in studies of similar topics. (Yang et. al, 2023) so it was expected that our model get somewhere close to that range as well. However, the results show that we although the model got close it fell short of the precision of literature models. This makes sense as this model is only a rudimentary model and not as complicated as well as does not have as many datapoints as others in literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPACT OF FINDINGS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Such findings could have significant implications for healthcare practices and policies. For instance, they could underscore the importance of considering sex-specific differences in the development and evaluation of predictive models for heart disease diagnosis. (Ahmad, 2023). Furthermore, both studies cited in this report as well as many other studies in journals all chose to differenciate sex data in the development and evaluation of predictive models. Additionally, it might prompt further investigation into the factors contributing to the disparity in model performance between male and female patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FUTURE QUESTIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings could lead to several future research questions, such as:\n",
    "1. What are the underlying reasons for the disparity in model performance between male and female patients?\n",
    "2. Are there additional patient attributes or variables that should be considered to improve the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis models for female patients?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these findings highlight the importance of ongoing research and development efforts to address sex-specific differences in heart disease diagnosis and treatment, ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes for all patients.?"
