    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heart disease is a significant global health concern; it is the *leading cause of death globally*. To address this issue effectively, it is vital to develop accurate diagnostic tools. Fortunately, there are many patient attributes that could serve as indicators or possible warning signs for heart disease, which could accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment. In this project, we will employ classification techniques to predict the diagnosis of heart disease based on a few of these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research question:** Will a patient be diagnosed with heart disease, given their age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate achieved, while considering sex differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use to answer this question is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which comprises multivariate numerical and categorical data on 14 patient attributes. These include age, sex, chest pain type, etc. along with the patient's diagnosis. For this project, we will focus on a subset of attributes: \n",
    "- age\n",
    "- resting blood pressure\n",
    "- serum cholesterol\n",
    "- maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "to predict the diagnosis of heart disease. We will filter the dataset to include only records from the Cleveland location to ensure consistency and relevance. By the end of this project, we aim to develop accurate predictive models for diagnosing heart disease based on patient attributes."

We will then split the data into training and testing sets. The disease classes will be combined into one because some of the original classes had too few observations to use classification effectively. **need reference** \n",
    "Then, we will select the following predictors: age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate.\n",
    "These were chosen because they are numerical variables, which are much more useful than the other categorical variables for KNN classification, and they also do not have any missing data. **need reference** \n",
    "\n",
    "For model fitting and evaluation, we will split the training and testing sets both into male and female sets, due to the notable sex differences in diagnoses and predictor variables (see graphs above **add reference**). We will be training a K-nearest neighbours classification model, so we will first need to use a recipe to scale and center the data. The model will be trained on the training set, using cross-validation to choose the optimal value of K, then evaluated on the testing set using accuracy, precision, and recall. Recall will be prioritized because false negative predictions (classifying disease \"present\" as \"absent\") are more costly. This evaluation process will be conducted separately for male and female categories to account for sex-specific variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will visualize our findings by creating four scatter plots with the **training data**, each representing a unique combination of variables. For each sex, we will plot blood pressure against age and maximum heart rate against cholesterol, colouring points by the patient's predicted diagnosis. The plot background will be coloured according to the predicted class at each point. This can be done for several values of K during the cross-validation to assess under- or over-fitting. These scatter plots will serve to identify any discernible patterns or correlations between the selected variables and heart disease diagnosis, facilitating the interpretation of our predictive models.  \n",
